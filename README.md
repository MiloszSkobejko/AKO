# Assembly and C Programming Examples

This repository contains a collection of programming examples completed mostly in x86 assembly language and occasionally in the C programming language. These examples require a basic understanding of assembly language and were compiled using the MASM assembler.

## Introduction

This repository serves as a resource for learning and practicing assembly language programming, specifically focusing on x86 architecture. The examples included here cover various concepts, such as handling Polish characters in the console, working with UTF-8 and UTF-16 encodings, array manipulation, memory allocation and management, stack usage and tracking, passing arguments as parameters and references, as well as writing assembly subroutines (functions) for C programs.

## Prerequisites

To compile and run the examples in this repository, you need to have the following software installed on your system:

- MASM (Microsoft Macro Assembler) - for assembling the x86 assembly code
- Microsoft Visual Studio or any C compiler of choice - for compiling and running C programs

## Getting Started

To get started with the examples, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine or download it as a ZIP archive.
2. Ensure that MASM and a C compiler are installed on your system.
3. Navigate to the directory of the desired example.
4. Read the source code files (*.asm and *.c) to understand the logic and purpose of the example.
5. Use MASM to assemble the assembly code and generate an executable file.
6. Compile the C code (if applicable) and link it with the generated assembly executable.
7. Run the resulting program and observe the output.

## Topics Covered

The examples in this repository cover a wide range of topics related to assembly language programming and its integration with C programs. Some of the key concepts explored in the examples include:

- Handling Polish characters in the console
- UTF-8 and UTF-16 encodings
- Array manipulation and memory allocation
- Memory management techniques
- Stack usage and tracking
- Passing arguments as parameters and references
- Writing assembly subroutines (functions) for C programs

Each example focuses on a specific topic and provides a practical implementation to reinforce the understanding of these concepts.

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

```
root/
├── lab1/
│ ├── example1/
│ ├── example2/
│ └── ...
├── lab2/
│ ├── example1/
│ ├── example2/
│ └── ...
...
```
The examples are organized into separate directories for each laboratory assignment. Within each lab directory, you will find individual example directories, each containing the source code and any necessary files for that specific example.

## Contributing
This repository is a static collection of programming examples and will no longer be updated or expanded. Therefore, I am not accepting contributions at this time.
